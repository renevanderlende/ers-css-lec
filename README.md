## Compiling TypeScript

The TypeScript files used here have been written such that the output JavaScript files are compliant with `import` syntax.

To begin, run `npm i` to gather all dependencies, after the download has finished you will be able to use the two compiler commands in `package.json` :

- `$ npm run build-ts`

  > Compile all Typescript files from `src/` to JavaScript in `build/` . (actual command: `tsc` )

- `$ npm run build-src`

  > Compile all Typescript and JavaScript files from `src/` to JavaScript in `build/` . (actual command: `tsc --allowjs true` )
